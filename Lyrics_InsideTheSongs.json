Open wide\nHere comes the content\nIt's a beautiful day to stay inside"

(Recorded laughter)\nRearranging\nIt's like everything happened all at once\nUm, what the fuck is going on? (Recorded laughter)\nThe people rising in the streets\nThe war, the drought\nThe more I look, the more I see nothing to joke about\nIs comedy over?\nShould I leave you alone?\n'Cause, really, who's gonna go for joking at a time like this?\nShould I be joking at a time like this?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Bo Burnham]\nI wanna help to leave this world better than I found it\nAnd I fear that comedy won't help, and the fear is not unfounded\nShould I stop trying to be funny?\nShould I give away my money? No!\nWhat do I do?\n\n[Chorus: Bo Burnham & Ethereal Voice]\nHealing the world with comedy\nThe indescribable power of your comedy\nThe world needs direction\nFrom a white guy like me (Bingo)\nWho is healing the world with comedy\nThat's it\n[Spoken: Bo Burnham]\nThe world is so fucked up. Systematic oppression, income inequality, the other stuff... And there's only one thing that I can do about it. While\u2014 While being paid and being the center of attention\n\n[Chorus: Bo Burnham]\nHealing the world with comedy\nMaking a literal difference, metaphorically\nA Jew walks into a bar, and I've saved him a seat\nThat's healing the world with comedy\n\n[Verse 2: Bo Burnham]\nI'm a special kind of white guy\nI self-reflected, and I want to be an agent of change\nSo I am gonna use my privilege for the good (Very cool, way to go!)\nAmerican white guys\nWe've had the floor for at least 400 years\nSo maybe I should just shut the fuck up...\nI'm bored\nI don't wanna do that\nThere's got to be another way (Yes)\nFor me to help out without standing on the sidelines (Never!)\nThe wait is over\nI'm white, and I'm here to save the day\nLord, help me channel Sandra Bullock in The Blind Side (Sandra Bullock!)\n\n[Chorus: Bo Burnham]\nHealing the world with comedy\nMaking a literal difference, metaphorically\nAnd yes, most likely, they'll pay me, but I'd do it for free\nI am healing the world with comedy\n[Bridge: Bo Burnham]\nIf you wake up in a house that's full of smoke\nDon't panic\u2014call me and I'll tell you a joke\nIf you see white men dressed in white cloaks\nDon't panic\u2014call me and I'll tell you a joke\nOh, shit\nShould I be joking at a time like this?\nIf you start to smell burning toast\nYou're having a stroke or overcooking your toast\nIf you wake up in a house that's full of smoke\nDon't panic\u2014call me and I'll tell you a joke\nIf you see white men dressed in white cloaks\nDon't panic\u2014call me and I'll tell you a joke\nOh, shit\nShould I be joking at a time like this?\nSomebody help me out 'cause I don't know\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Bo Burnham]\nAnd I want to help to leave this world better than I found it\nAnd I fear that comedy won't help, and the fear is not unfounded\nShould I stop trying to be funny?\nShould I give away my money? No!\nI know what I gotta do\n\n[Chorus: Bo Burnham]\nHealing the world with comedy\nMaking a literal difference, metaphorically\nI swore I'd never be back, and now, I'm back on my feet\nAnd I'm healing the world with comedy"

    "lyrics": "[Intro: Bo Burnham]\nHey, kids\nToday, we're gonna learn about the world\n\n[Verse 1: Bo Burnham]\nThe world that's around us is pretty amazing\nBut how does it work? It must be comp-l-icated\nThe secret is: The world can only work\nWhen everything works together\nA bee drinks from a flower and leaves with its pollen\nA squirrel in a tree spreads the seeds that have fallen\nEverything works together\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Bo Burnham]\nThe biggest elephant, the littlest fly\nThe gophers underground, the birds in the sky\nAnd every single cricket, every fish in the sea\nGives what they can and gets what they need\n\n[Chorus: Bo Burnham]\nThat is how the world works\nThat is how the world works\nFrom \"A\" to \"zebra\" to the worms in the dirt\nThat's how it works\n\n[Interlude 1: Bo Burnham & Socko]\nHey, everyone, look who stopped by to say hello! It's Socko!\nHey!\nWhere you been, Socko?\nI've been where I always am when you're not wearing me on your hand: in a frightening, liminal space between states of being! Not quite dead, not quite alive! It's similar to a constant state of sleep paralysis\nSocko, we were just talking about the world and how it works\nBoy, that sounds complicated!\nDo you have anything you'd want to teach us about the world?\nI wouldn't say anything that you probably haven't already said yourself\nI don't know about that, Socko. How about you give it a try?\nAll right!\n[Verse 2: Socko]\nThe simple narrative taught in every history class\nIs demonstrably false and pedagogically classist\nDon't you know? The world is built with blood!\nAnd genocide! And exploitation!\nThe global network of capital essentially functions\nTo separate the worker from the means of production\nAnd the FBI killed Martin Luther King\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Socko]\nPrivate property's inherently theft\nAnd neoliberal fascists are destroying the left\nAnd every politician, every cop on the street\nProtects the interests of the pedophilic corporate elite\n\n[Chorus: Socko, Bo Burnham & Both]\nThat is how the world works (Really?)\nThat is how the world works\nGenocide the Natives, say you got to it first\nThat's how it works\n\n[Interlude 2: Bo Burnham & Socko]\nThat's pretty intense\nNo shit!\nWhat can I do to help?\nRead a book or something, I don't know. Just don't burden me with the responsibility of educating you. It's incredibly exhausting!\nI'm sorry, Socko. I was just trying to become a better person\nWhy do you rich fucking white people insist on seeing every socio-political conflict through the myopic lens of your own self-actualization? This isn't about you! So either get with it or get out of the fucking way!\nWatch your mouth, buddy. Remember who's on whose hand here\nBut that's what I've\u2014 Have you not been fucking listening? We are entrenched in\u2014\nAlright! Alright! I... Wait, wait, wait! No, please! I don't wanna go back, please! I can't go\u2014 I can't go back! Please! Please. I'm sorry\nAre you gonna behave yourself?\nYes\n\"Yes,\" what?\nYes, sir\nLook at me\nYes, sir\nThat's better\n[Chorus: Bo Burnham, Socko & Both]\nThat is how the world works\nThat is how the world works\nI hope you learned your lesson! (I did, and it hurt!)\nThat's how it works\n\n[Outro: Socko]\nNo!"

Have a look around\nAnything that brain of yours can think of can be found\nWe've got mountains of content\u2014some better, some worse\nIf none of it's of interest to you, you'd be the first\n\n[Verse 2]\nWelcome to the internet! Come and take a seat\nWould you like to see the news or any famous women's feet?\nThere's no need to panic; this isn't a test, haha\nJust nod or shake your head, and we'll do the rest\n\n[Verse 3]\nWelcome to th\u0435 internet! What would you pref\u0435r?\nWould you like to fight for civil rights or tweet a racial slur?\nBe happy! Be horny! Be bursting with rage!\nWe've got a million different ways to engage\n\n[Verse 4]\nWelcome to the internet! Put your cares aside\nHere's a tip for straining pasta; here's a nine-year-old who died\nWe've got movies and doctors and fantasy sports\nAnd a bunch of colored-pencil drawings of all the different characters in Harry Potter fucking each other\n\n[Verse 5]\nWelcome to the internet! Hold on to your socks\n'Cause a random guy just kindly sent you photos of his cock\nThey are grainy and off-putting; he just sent you more\nDon't act surprised\u2014you know you like it, you whore\n[Verse 6]\nSee a man beheaded, get offended, see a shrink\nShow us pictures of your children, tell us every thought you think\nStart a rumor, buy a broomer, send a death threat to a boomer\nOr DM a girl and groom her; do a zoomer find a tumor in your\u2014\nHere's a healthy breakfast option, you should kill your mom\nHere's why women never fuck you; here's how you can build a bomb\nWhich Power Ranger are you? Take this quirky quiz\nObama sent the immigrants to vaccinate your kids\n\n[Chorus]\nCould I interest you in everything all of the time?\nA little bit of everything all of the time\nApathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime\nAnything and everything all of the time\nCould I interest you in everything all of the time?\nA little bit of everything all of the time\nApathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime\nAnything and everything all of the time\n\n[Spoken Interlude]\nYou know, it wasn't always like this\n\n[Bridge]\nNot very long ago, just before your time\nRight before the towers fell, circa '99\nThis was catalogs, travel blogs, a chatroom or two\nWe set our sights and spent our nights waiting for you!\nYou, insatiable you\nMommy let you use her iPad; you were barely two\nAnd it did all the things we designed it to do\nNow, look at you! Oh, look at you!\nYou, you! Unstoppable, watchable\nYour time is now, your inside's out, honey, how you grew\nAnd if we stick together, who knows what we'll do?\nIt was always the plan to put the world in your hand\n[Break]\n(*Laughs*)\n\n[Chorus]\nCould I interest you in everything all of the time?\nA bit of everything all of the time\nApathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime\nAnything and everything all of the time\nCould I interest you in everything all of the time?\nA little bit of everything all of the time\nApathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime\nAnything and everything and anything and everything\nAnd anything and everything and\nAll of the time"

Are you having fun?\nIt's almost over, it's just begun\nDon't overthink this, look in my eye\nDon't be scared, don't be shy\nCome on in, the water's fine\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe're goin' to go where everybody knows\nEverybody knows, everybody, oh\nWe're goin' to go where everybody knows\nEverybody knows\n\n[Chorus]\nGet your fuckin' hands up\nGet on out of your seat\nAll eyes on me, all eyes on me\nAyy, come on, get your fuckin' hands up\nGet on out of your seat\nAll eyes on me, all eyes on me, yeah, come on\nHeads down, pray for me\nHeads down now, pray for me\nGet your fuckin' hands up\nGet on out of your seat\nAll eyes on me, all eyes on me\n[Interlude]\nYou wanna hear a funny story?\nSo, uh, five years ago, I quit performing live comedy\nBecause I was beginning to have, uh, severe panic attacks while on stage\nWhich is not a great place to have them\nSo I, I quit, and I didn't perform for five years\nAnd I spent that time trying to improve myself mentally\nAnd you know what? I did! I got better\nI got so much better, in fact, that in January of 2020\nI thought, \"You know what? I should start performing again\nI've been hiding from the world and I need to re-enter\"\nAnd then, the funniest thing happened\n\n[Verse 2]\nAre you feeling nervous? Are you having fun?\nIt's almost over, it's just begun\nDon't overthink this, look in my eye\nDon't be scared, don't be shy\nCome on in, the water's fine\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou say the ocean's rising like I give a shit\nYou say the whole world's ending, honey, it already did\nYou're not gonna slow it, Heaven knows you tried\nGot it? Good, now get inside\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe're goin' to go where everybody knows\nEverybody knows, everybody knows\nWe're goin' to go where everybody knows\nEverybody knows\n\n[Chorus]\nCome on, get your fuckin' hands up\nGet on out of your seat\nAll eyes on me, all eyes on me\nHey, come on, get your fuckin' hands up\nGet on out of your seats\nAll eyes on me, all eyes on me, yeah\nHeads down, pray for me\nHeads down now, pray for me\nI said get your fuckin' hands up\nGet up, get up\nI'm talkin' to you, get the fuck up\n\n[Chorus]\nGet your fuckin' hands up\nGet on out of your seat\nAll eyes on me, all eyes on me\nAyy, fuckin' get your fuckin' hands up\nGet on out of your seat\nAll eyes on me, all eyes on me, yeah\nCome on, heads down, pray for me\nHeads down now, pray for me\nI said get your fuckin' hands up\nGet on\u2014\nAll eyes on me, all eyes on me"

Would I \u0435ven know?\nAm I right back where I start\u0435d fourteen years ago?\nWanna guess the ending? If it ever does\nI swear to God that all I've ever wanted was\nA little bit of everything all of the time\nA bit of everything all of the time\nApathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime\nI'm finished playin', and I'm stayin' inside\nIf I wake up in a house that's full of smoke\nI'll panic, so call me up and tell me a joke\nWhen I'm fully irrelevant and totally broken, damn it\nCall me up and tell me a joke\nOh, shit\nYou're really joking at a time like this?\n\n[Outro]\nWell, well, look who's inside again\nWent out to look for a reason to hide again\nWell, well, buddy, you found it\nNow come out with your hands up\nWe've got you surrounded"
